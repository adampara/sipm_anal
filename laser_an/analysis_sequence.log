Create new ntuples bascor_nt using tau = 8e-5

run average_waveforms with coh=0
run noise_fit with coh=0

Average waveforms seem to have their baseline displaced from zero. Is it the result of the baselijne correction?

Add ntuple names to the file names and run the average_waveform in parallel.

In noise_fit add file_t to the baseline_mean/sigma data files.
Add file_t argument to the get_coh_noise kumac and modify the kumac itself accordingly
modify the file names produced by coh_noise.kumac

July 18..

coherent noise was all zero's and all the results were affected.. traced back 
to the missing vector par in coh_noise.kumac (?? how did it happen??)

put the array par and checked that the coherent noise is evaluated correctly..
