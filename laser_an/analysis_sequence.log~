Average waveforms seem to have their baseline displaced from zero. Is it the result of the baselijne correction?

Add ntuple names to the file names and run the average_waveform in parallel.

In noise_fit add file_t to the baseline_mean/sigma data files.
Add file_t argument to the get_coh_noise kumac and modify the kumac itself accordingly
modify the file names produced by coh_noise.kumac
